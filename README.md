##  About

Agenda project from [Luiz Ot√°vio Miranda's Python course](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-3-do-zero-ao-avancado/).

In this project I had to learn and apply *Django* concepts as well as *HTML* and *CSS* for the templates and *PostgreSQL* for the database.
In the end, I decided to put the application online using the *Google Cloud* service, and so I was able to learn about servers, networking, hosting, etc.

**(Note: I don't know how long the server will be online, it might not work anymore =( )**
